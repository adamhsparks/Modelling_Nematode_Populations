This repository contains the Rmd file for the “Fitting Linear and Quadratic Models of Nematode Population Responses to Time and Temperature”.

The [Fitting\_Nematode\_Models.Rmd](Fitting_Nematode_Models.Rmd) file contains the markdown, which was reviewed by [@emdelponte](https://github.com/emdelponte) and
[@mladencucak](https://github.com/mladencucak)to generate the content of the blog post.

The original post was hosted on OpenPlantPathology but has since moved to my personal site, https://adamhsparks.com/post/fitting_nematode_models/fitting_nematode_models.html.
